Enforces a restriction on nodes that are group posts. Members belonging to the same group that the node belongs to can signup.

This allows you to keep nodes visible to non-group members, and deny them from signing up.

An alternative to this would be making the group post private.

Nodes that are not group posts, and therefore have no relation to a group, are not affected.
